//webpack is a JS bundler that helps minify and optimize JS build files. It is mainly built for JS, but can also deal with HTML and css assets.
//The basic idea behind webpack is to provide a starting point for webpack and that file to include other js files which will be clubbed/bundled into an optimized file.
//We shoudl also provide an output directory where the build files needs to be located.

  "scripts":{
    "build":"webpack-dev-server ./src/js/starter.js --output-filename ./distribution/bundle.js"
    ...

  }

}

//The entry and output file dirs are relative to the location of package.json 
//The scripts are then executed using npm run build/npm run build --prod
