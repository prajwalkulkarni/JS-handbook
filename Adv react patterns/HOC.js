//HOC is similar to higher order function on component basis. HOCs are designed to create a ground for components that share a common bheavior. Instead of rewriting 
//the same logic in every component that requires this functionality, HOCs can be written and this common set of functionalities can be placed there. This way any component
//that wants to access this feature can wrap iteself to this shared component. HOCs do not mutate the original component, it instead adds some shared behavior the 
//component and returns a new component.
